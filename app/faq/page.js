                <h4>Can I buy real products here?</h4>
                <p>
                    No, the products in this shop are not real. This shop only exists to showcase my skills as a full-stack developer. 
                    Please do not spend any real money here. I do encourage you to buy actual coffee beans and high quality matcha 
                    from reputable stores and local coffee shops.

                <h4>Why did you make coffee and matcha the theme of your e-commerce shop?</h4>
                <p>
                    I work in a coffee shop and love to make coffee, so this is something that shows my interest and who I am as a person.
                </p>
                <h4>Why is it so expensive to get into making coffee and matcha?</h4>
                <p>
                    Making good quality specialty coffee is a lot more complicated than you would think. It takes a lot of precision and skill 
                    to get the right espresso shot and to steam milk properly. Furthermore, high quality equipment is necessary to get those things
                    right. There are a lot of equipments out there for beginners who are starting off, and those would be around $500-$700 range 
                    on average. Additionally, matcha is a naturally expensive ingredient due to the labor that goes into harvesting it and the 
                    limited supply from Japan.

                <h4>Does the email subscription service actually work?</h4>
                <p>
                    No, it does not work. It is only there for style and to make the shop look more complete.
